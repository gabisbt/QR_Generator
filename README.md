# QR_Generator
The code uses the inquirer npm package to prompt the user to enter a URL. It also uses the qr-image npm package to turn the user entered URL into a QR code image.  The code uses the native fs node module to save the user input to a file called URL.txt. If there are any errors, it will log the error to the console.
